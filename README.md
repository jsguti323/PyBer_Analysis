# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In our analysis, we created a DataFrame that breaks down ride sharing data based on city type, those types being urban, suburban, and rural. Once we had our data cleaned up and organized, we created a multiple-line graph that shows total weekly fares by city type. With our data and our graph, we were able to identify key differences between the urban, suburban, and rural cities. 
## Results

Urban cities far and away had the most riders and drivers, which resulted in the overall largest dollar amount in fares; however, urban citites were the lowest among city types when we looked at average fare per ride and average fare per driver. For average fare per ride and driver, rural citites had the highest dollar amount. In all aforementioned categories, suburban cities were consistently in the middle of the pack.

From February to April the trends in total fares for all three city types look similar: the data peaks at the end of Febraury, dips at the beginning of March, and then peaks again in mid March. In January, the trends for suburban and urban citites are similar, but the trends for rural cities are almost the opposite: urban and suburban cities see a steady increase in fares while rural cities' fares fluctuate but ultimately remain the same. In April, fares in urban and rural cities dip but fares in suburban cities increase.
## Summary
Bases on the results, I would make the following recommendations:
* Increase the fare dollar amount in the beginning of the year for urban, suburban, and rural cities. Regardless of city type, the lowest total fare amount was at the beginning of January. 
* Incentivize drivers to work in rural and suburban areas. There were signficantly more drivers in than rides available in urban cities, which led to lower average fares per drivers. For drivers, they believe there is more work to be had in urban cities as rides are higher in demand, but if everyone followes this logic the supply of drivers becomes oversaturated. In rural cities, the average fare per driver is $55.49. I think more drivers would be present in rural and suburban cities if they undestood this. Plus, an increased supply of drivers in those areas could make the service more available and thus lead to more rides as well.
* Increase the fare amount in urban areas. Though we can make an effort to send more drivers to other city types, we can still increae profits by increasing the fare amounts for urban areas. In those cities the demand for ride-sharing will always be high, but drivers aren't making much off of the fares because those rides are typically shorter in distance/duration. If we are going to redistribute the drivers among the various city types, we still would need to take care of the drivers remaining in the urban areas as that is where most of the profits are coming from.
