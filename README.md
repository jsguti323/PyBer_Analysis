# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In our analysis, we created a DataFrame that breaks down ride sharing data based on city type, those types being urban, suburban, and rural. Once we had our data cleaned up and organized, we created a multiple-line graph that shows total weekly fares by city type. With our data and our graph, we were able to identify key differences between the urban, suburban, and rural cities. 
## Results

Urban cities far and away had the most riders and drivers, which resulted in the overall largest dollar amount in fares; however, urban citites were the lowest among city types when we looked at average fare per ride and average fare per driver. For average fare per ride and driver, rural citites had the highest dollar amount. In all aforementioned categories, suburban cities were consistently in the middle of the pack.

From February to April the trends in total fares for all three city types look similar: the data peaks at the end of Febraury, dips at the beginning of March, and then peaks again in mid March. In January, the trends for suburban and urban citites are similar, but the trends for rural cities are almost the opposite: urban and suburban cities see a steady increase in fares while rural cities' fares fluctuate but ultimately remain the same. In April, fares in urban and rural cities dip but fares in suburban cities increase.
